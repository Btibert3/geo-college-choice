Recently I came across the following post on Twitter :

## Goals

Map the graph of colleges (complete, but maybe add more schools)

Show how local the graph is (complete with New England)

Migration Data from IPEDS (spider graph)

Circular graph of IPEDS data to show stay close [Circle Graphs](http://gjabel.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/circular-migration-flow-plots-in-r/)

hairball of the graph (sans geo) with igraph

introduce the idea of using the graph for recommending engines (user/school)

Can the school graph predict the change in apps (or explain some variance in apps, is there brand value there?)
