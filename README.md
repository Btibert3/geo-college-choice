## Goals

Map the graph of colleges

Show how local the graph is

hairball of the graph (sans geo)

introduce the idea of recommending engines (user/school)

Can your graph predict the change in apps (or explain some variance in apps, is there brand value there?)

Predict user/schools with FAFSA data
